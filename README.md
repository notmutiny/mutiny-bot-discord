# not mutiny    \_(:3」∠)\\\_
My bot I write for fun. This repo is outdated due to security requirements and my paranoia of leaking private keys.

`exports.Start = function() { [...] }` is included for use with my C# program. Remove those lines if used without it. 

This bot requires `./logs.txt`, `./saved_users.json`, and being mutiny. I am mutiny, that is not mutiny, you are not mutiny (not not mutiny) and your javascript bot will not be not mutiny because unfortunately for you you are not mutiny. Okay?
