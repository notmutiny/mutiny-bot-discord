# not mutiny
My web bot I write for fun. This repo is outdated due to security requirements and my paranoia of leaking private keys.

`exports.Start = function() { [...] }` is for use with my C# program. Remove if used without program. Bot requires logs.txt, saved_users.json, and being mutiny. I am mutiny, that is not mutiny, you are not mutiny (not not mutiny) and your bot will not be not mutiny because you are not mutiny. Okay?
